#14. In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. 
  #Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 12, and 
  #populate the associated data from the contact_data array. Hint: you will probably 
  #need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might 
  #be the Array shift and first methods.
